	abstract = {Despite extensive efforts, extracting medication exposure
                  information from clinical records remains challenging. To
                  complement this approach, here we show the Global Natural
                  Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) Drug Library, a
                  tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based resource designed for
                  drug screening with untargeted metabolomics. This resource
                  integrates MS/MS references of drugs and their
                  metabolites/analogs with standardized vocabularies on their
                  exposure sources, pharmacologic classes, therapeutic
                  indications, and mechanisms of action. It enables direct
                  analysis of drug exposure and metabolism from untargeted
                  metabolomics data, supporting flexible summarization at
                  multiple ontology levels to align with different research
                  goals. We demonstrate its application by stratifying
                  participants in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cohort
                  based on detected drug exposures. We uncover drug-associated
                  alterations in microbiota-derived N-acyl lipids that are not
                  captured when stratifying by self-reported medication
                  use. Overall, GNPS Drug Library provides a scalable resource
                  for empirical drug screening in clinical, nutritional,
                  environmental, and other research disciplines, facilitating
                  insights into the ecological and health consequences of drug
                  exposures. While not intended for immediate clinical
                  decision-making, it supports data-driven exploration of drug
                  exposures where traditional records are limited or
                  unreliable.},

	abstract = {The open spectral library MassBank (https://massbank.jp/)
                  started in 2006 in Japan, as one of the first open source and
                  open access cross-vendor mass spectral libraries. The first
                  dedicated European MassBank server (https://massbank.eu/) was
                  launched in 2011, adding spectra from compounds of
                  environmental relevance to complement the original
                  metabolomics focus. Recent developments boosted the FAIRness
                  of MassBank data, and a redesigned web interface with modern
                  architecture was launched in 2025. All records are under
                  version control, and versioned releases are pushed to an
                  independent data repository with digital object identifier
                  assigned to each data release. Semantic metadata integrates
                  the spectral data into the world of linked open data. The
                  record format enables many downstream studies, and records are
                  validated by an automated pipeline to ensure data quality upon
                  submission and review existing records. The SPectraL hASH was
                  added for spectral content-based access. MassBank is
                  cross-integrated in several resources such as MassBank of
                  North America, Global Natural Product Social Molecular
                  Networking, PubChem, the US EPA CompTox Dashboard, NORMAN
                  Database System, RforMassSpectrometry, and more. MassBank now
                  boasts a total of 119 845 spectra of 18 529 compounds from 53
                  contributors from around the world.},

	abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (https://hmdb.ca) has
                  been providing comprehensive reference information about human
                  metabolites and their associated biological, physiological and
                  chemical properties since 2007. Over the past 15 years, the
                  HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of
                  the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes
                  in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB
                  5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to
                  the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more
                  appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular,
                  these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the
                  number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920
                  compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of
                  metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure,
                  spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion
                  of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data
                  sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately
                  predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and
                  predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to
                  the HMDB’s search functions to facilitate better compound
                  identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to
                  the content, the interface, and general performance of the
                  HMDB website have also been made. Overall, we believe these
                  upgrades and updates should greatly enhance the HMDB’s ease of
                  use and its potential applications not only in human
                  metabolomics but also in exposomics, lipidomics, nutritional
                  science, biochemistry and clinical chemistry.},
