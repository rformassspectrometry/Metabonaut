Welcome to **Metabonaut**! :astronaut:

This initiative presents a series of workflows based on a small LC-MS/MS dataset, 
utilizing R and Bioconductor packages. Throughout these workflows, we demonstrate 
how to adapt various algorithms to specific datasets and how to seamlessly 
integrate R packages to ensure efficient, reproducible processing.

The primary workflow is the 
["Complete End-to-End LC-MS/MS Metabolomic Data Analysis"](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/metabonaut/articles/end-to-end-untargeted-metabolomics.html).

The full R code for all examples, along with detailed descriptions, is available 
in the 
[end-to-end-untargeted-metabolomics.Rmd](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/metabonaut/vignettes/end-to-end-untargeted-metabolomics.Rmd) 
file. This file can be opened in RStudio, allowing you to execute each individual 
R command (see the section below for additional required R packages).

Other vignettes on this website are interlinked, and you can find a detailed 
description of the dataset used throughout 
[here](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/metabonaut/articles/dataset-investigation.html).

We strive for reproducibility. These workflows are designed to remain stable 
over time, allowing you to run all the vignettes together as one comprehensive 
"super-vignette."

## Important Notes

The tutorials provided assume that users have basic knowledge of R and RMarkdown. 
If you're unfamiliar with either, we recommend completing a short tutorial to help 
you test the code and adapt it to your data. For RMarkdown, click 
[here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). For R, check out 
[this](https://learn-r.org/) or try an interactive course 
[here](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) for a fun introduction to basic R 
programming.

## Known Issues

This is just the beginning of our Metabonaut journey, and the website is still 
being refined. We're actively addressing any ongoing issues. If we're aware of a 
problem, we'll list it below.

Currently, there are no known issues with the code. If you encounter any, please 
ensure you have the latest versions of all required packages (as detailed above). 
If the issue persists, please report it with a reproducible example on GitHub 
[here](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/metabonaut/issues).

If you encounter any other issues, don't hesitate to let us know!
