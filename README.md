## Welcome to **Metabonaut**! 🚀  

Metabonaut presents a series of workflows based on a small LC-MS/MS dataset, utilizing **R** and **Bioconductor** packages. These workflows demonstrate how to adapt various algorithms to specific datasets and seamlessly integrate R packages for efficient, reproducible data processing.  

## Available Vignettes  

### 1. [Complete End-to-End LC-MS/MS Metabolomic Data Analysis](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Metabonaut/articles/a-end-to-end-untargeted-metabolomics.html)  
This primary workflow guides you through each step of the analysis, from
**preprocessing raw data** to **statistical analysis** and **metabolite annotation**.  
📄 Full R code: [end-to-end-untargeted-metabolomics.qmd](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Metabonaut/vignettes/a-end-to-end-untargeted-metabolomics.qmd)  

### 2. [Dataset Investigation](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Metabonaut/articles/dataset-investigation.html)  
Before diving into the analysis, learn about **key aspects to examine in your dataset** to ensure smooth processing and avoid troubleshooting later.  

### 3. [Seamless Alignment: Merging New Data with an Existing Preprocessed Dataset](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Metabonaut/articles/alignment-to-external-dataset.html)  
Discover how to use a **flexible alignment algorithm** to integrate new 
datasets with previously processed ones based on features of interest.  

### 4. [LC-MS/MS Data Annotation using R and Python](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Metabonaut/articles/SpectriPy_tutorial_metabonaut.html)
Explore the **SpectriPy** package for **LC-MS/MS data annotation**. This 
tutorial demonstrates how to combining the strengths of Python and R MS 
libraries for annotation.

## 📌 Reproducibility & Updates  

We strive for **reproducibility**. These workflows are designed to remain stable over time, allowing you to run all vignettes together as one comprehensive **super-vignette**.  

- **Major updates** will be documented here.  
- **Minor updates** can be found in the [News section](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Metabonaut/news/index.html).

## 🎓 For R Beginners  

The tutorials assume basic knowledge of **R** and **RMarkdown**. If you're new to these, we recommend starting with a short tutorial before running the vignettes.  

- **Learn Quarto (used for vignettes)**: [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)  
- **Learn RMarkdown**: [RMarkdown Book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)  
- **Intro to R**: [Learn-R.org](https://learn-r.org/)  
- **Interactive R course**: [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)  
- **Best Practices Cheatsheet**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wurli/r-best-practice)
